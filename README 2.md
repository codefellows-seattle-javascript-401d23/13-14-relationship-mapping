# LAB 13 Relationship Mapping

**Author**: Joshua Fredrickson

**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
Lab 13 is a Store API that accepts HTTP CRUD requests into a Mongo Data Base.


## Getting Started
To use the Lab 13 application, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
(Node Package manager), and [Mongo DB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)  will need
 to be locally installed.  Once Node.js, npm, Mongo DB have been installed, install the Lab 13 files.  
 Prior to starting the Lab 13 application, from the command line while you are in the Lab13 file 
 folder, enter the command `npm i`.  This will download all needed dependencies for the 
 application to run.   


## Architecture
This application was deployed with the following technologies.
Node.js, npm, body-parser, dotenv, express, faker, mongoose, winston, babel, superagent, 
http-errors, jest, eslint, JavaScript
    
SERVER ENDPOINTS 
POST /api/store
GET /api/shoes/:id
PUT /api/shoes/:id
DELETE /api/shoes/:id
